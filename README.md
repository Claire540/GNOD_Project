1.Removed Features

- Time signature : is a musical notation that indicates the number of beats in each musical measure and the type of note that receives a regular pulse.
This is not relevant to make a cluster because too many musics can have the same time signature.

- Tempo : the speed, the pulse.
This is not relevant to make a cluster because too many musics can have the same pulse.

- Loudness : Represents the sound intensity of a song in decibels (dB). A higher value indicates a louder song.
Loudness is about the mixing, so it's not relevant to make a cluster.

- Key : Indicates the main key of the song.
This is not relevant to make a cluster because too many musics can have the same key.


- Mode : Indicates whether the song is in major mode (1) or minor mode (0).
This is not relevant to make a cluster because too many musics can have the same mode.

- Liveness : Indicates the probability that a song was recorded during a live concert rather than in a studio.
This is not relevant to make a cluster because too many musics can be live.

We have imagined a plateform dedicated for 55-64 aged users : Vilyla, a user-firendly plateform for music lovers.
Indeed, these users do not take advantage of streaming platforms because several things push them away: creating an account, paying to listen to music, they don't want an app, and the plateforms like Spotify are too cluttered.
Vinyla is a very simple interface where you can enter the title of a song, listen to this song, and get a personalized playlist to continue your listening time.
